# Hi, I'm Kai Huang

**Founder @ [Universal FAW Labs](https://github.com/akaiHuang) | Creative Technologist | Ex-Ogilvy**

> Building self-evolving systems that compound value autonomously across domains.

15+ years bridging **Creative Design** and **Engineering Logic** — previously delivered campaigns for global brands like BMW, Porsche, Nike, and 7-ELEVEN through top 4A agencies. Now focused on **AI Agents**, **Generative AI**, and **Interactive 3D Experiences**.

## What I'm Building

<img src="assets/system-architecture.png" width="100%" alt="System Architecture: Sense → Understand → Act → Evolve" />

I architect systems across the full spectrum — from pixels to neural signals:

**Phase 1 — Sense the world.** Interfaces that bridge humans and machines: gesture recognition from EMG and cameras, brainwave EEG interfaces, and spatial computing.

**Phase 2 — Understand the world.** Crawlers, sentiment engines, and intelligence pipelines that parse markets, brands, governments, and social platforms at scale.

**Phase 3 — Act on the world.** Multi-agent orchestrators, autonomous traders, and automation bots that execute decisions without human bottlenecks.

**Phase 4 — Evolve.** Self-testing pipelines and backtesting optimizers that let systems improve themselves, closing the loop toward autonomous value creation.

> All wrapped in stunning 3D, shader-driven aesthetics — because engineering without beauty is only half the job.
